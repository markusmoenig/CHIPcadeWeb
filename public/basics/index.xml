      <description>v0.1.3 (2023-3-4) Analytical plane and sphere support for rendering. Especially the analytical plane is useful for rendering checker board floors without having to have a huge amount of SDF steps. Procedural background and material functions. First inbuilt procedural functions. Groove for subtraction. Bugfixes. v0.1.2 (2023-2-28) First modeling functions Integrated a Phong and PBR renderer as well as a BSDF pathtracer Working polygonization Started Forged Thoughts Development (2023-2-21) Another journey begins</description>

      <description>Forged Thoughts can be easily installed as a Rust subcommand.
First, if you do not have already, install Rust and cargo on your system by following the easy steps here.
After that you can install Forged Thoughts by typing the following command in your terminal:
cargo install ftc This installs ftc, the compiler and renderer front-end for Forged Thoughts. You can now invoke ftc in your terminal.
If you want to update ftc to the latest version just enter the above terminal command again.</description>

      <description>With Forged Thoughts you create distance fields using signed distance functions (or in short SDFs) and use raymarching to traverse them.
You can adjust the default raymarching settings in the global settings structure.
settings.steps = 1000; // The maximum steps the raymarcher executes, default is 500 settings.max_distance = 200.0; // The maximum distance rays traverse, default is 5.0 settings.step_size = 0.5; // The step size modifier, default is 1.0 With these 3 settings you can modify the raymarching inside Forged Thoughts.</description>
