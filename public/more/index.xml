      <description>A list of people without whom this project would not be possible:
Acknowledgements Inigo Quilez was my original inspiration for starting with signed distance functions, you can see his amazing work on Shadertoy and his research on his website.
Fabrice Neyret and his shaders were a great learning resource as well, he was also extremely helpful in answering questions. His research is here.
The Disney BSDF path tracer in Forged Thoughts (coming soon) is based on GLSL-PathTracer from Asif.</description>
